  caveats <<~EOS
    ThreadBeacon is currently an ad-hoc signed, unnotarized technical preview.
    If macOS shows "ThreadBeacon Not Opened" after the first launch:

      1. Choose Done, not Move to Trash.
      2. In Finder, Control-click /Applications/ThreadBeacon.app and choose Open.
      3. If it is still blocked, use System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway.

    Do not disable Gatekeeper or remove quarantine attributes with untrusted commands.
